This project is demonstrating basic website:

it fetches fake products from https://fakestoreapi.com/docs

it has basic CRUD operations -  note: update and create product are not actually modifying the database so i just logged the response to ensure those actions are successful

It builts on React using Typescript and for design I used MaterialUI library

I've also used axios package for the actions to the database(https://fakestoreapi.com)
